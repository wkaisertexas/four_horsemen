"AITA for stealing candy from a baby?

So, I was at the park with my friends and we saw a baby playing with a bag of candy. We were all really craving some candy, and the baby wasn't paying attention to it, so I took it from the baby. My friends were all shocked and said that I shouldn't have done it, but I didn't see the harm in it.

I got home and my sister found out what I did and she freaked out, saying that I'm a terrible person and that I should have known better.
