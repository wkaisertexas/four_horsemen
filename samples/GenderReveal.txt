"AITA for canceling my sister's baby shower because I didn't like the theme she picked?

My sister asked me to plan her baby shower as a surprise for her. I agreed, and I took charge of everything. I picked the date, the location, the menu, and I even made the invitations. But when she saw the invitations, she told me she didn't like the theme I picked and she wanted to change it.

I was so angry and hurt. I felt like my sister didn't appreciate all the hard work I put into planning the shower. So I told her that if she wanted to change the theme, she could plan the shower herself.

Now, my family is furious with me for canceling the shower, and my sister is devastated. But I don't think I did anything wrong. I offered to plan the shower, and I should be able to choose the theme.

So, AITA for canceling my sister's baby shower because I didn't like the theme she picked?
