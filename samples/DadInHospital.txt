"AITA for not visiting my dad in the hospital when he was dying of cancer?

My dad and I have never had a great relationship. He was never there for me growing up and we've always had a strained relationship. So when I found out he had cancer, I didn't really feel any different. He had always been so cruel and indifferent to me, why should I care now?

Well, my family is furious with me for not visiting him, not even once. They say that I should have put aside our differences and been there for him in his last days. But I don't see it that way. Why should I have to be the bigger person and make amends, when he never did?

I know it's not right, but I'm not sure I can apologize for something I don't feel guilty for.

So, AITA for not visiting my dad in the hospital when he was dying of cancer?"
