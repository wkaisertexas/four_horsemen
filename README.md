# The Four Horsemen

This project came from the observation that Tik Tok contains four key horsemen: the "family guy clip", the "splitscreen", the "AITA" and the "comment section". During this project, I will be recreating all of these projects and recreating an account for each.

`FFMPEG` is the library which makes all of this possible and is required for the installation

## The Family Guy Clip

The family guy clip is a staple of the Tik Tok community. In this video, a clip of a movie, tv show or short is playing on the top of the screen and below, a clip of an overstaturated game (typically "Subway Surfers") plays below.

These clips have the following defining characteristics: 
- Averaging a minute in length
- Being a part of a series which leads to watch streaks
    - Parts overlapp by an average of 5 seconds
- The original clip is edited from it's 16:9 resolution to 4:3 to make it take up more space on the screen

## Tik Tok Notes
Videos uploaded are in 1080p, but 1080x1920 versus the traditional 1920x1080.

## Future Work

The end goal of this project is to create a web-based tool which uses [FFmpeg.js](https://github.com/Kagami/ffmpeg.js/) and the [Tik Tok API](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/web-video-kit-with-web/)
